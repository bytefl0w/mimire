`mimire` is a CLI tool written in Zig to track and manage network security assessment directories and data. The name comes from the figure in Norse mythology that was known for his knowledge and wisdom to the gods.

## Motivation
I've never found a great way to organize data effectively for any type of security assessment. My goal with this tool is to provide an all-in-one solution everything just works. Spend more time on the actual work and let the tools automate the rest.

## Features include
- Export data into [JSON Canvas](https://jsoncanvas.org/) for mindmapping.
- Updating lists of targets on the fly
- Easily look up information
- Folder structure management
- Local storage via SQLite

## Future Ideas
- [ ] Different formats for stdout
- [ ] Tracking of bug bounty programs
